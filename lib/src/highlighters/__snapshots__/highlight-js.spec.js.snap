PureBASIC native IDE style ( version 1.0 - April 2016 )

by Tristano Ajmone <tajmone@gmail.com>

Public Domain

NOTE_1:	PureBASIC code syntax highlighting only applies the following classes:
			.hljs-comment
			.hljs-function
			.hljs-keywords
			.hljs-string
			.hljs-symbol

		Other classes are added here for the benefit of styling other languages with the look and feel of PureBASIC native IDE style.
		If you need to customize a stylesheet for PureBASIC only, remove all non-relevant classes -- PureBASIC-related classes are followed by
		a \\"--- used for PureBASIC ... ---\\" comment on same line.

NOTE_2:	Color names provided in comments were derived using \\"Name that Color\\" online tool:
